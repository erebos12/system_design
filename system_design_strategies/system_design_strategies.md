# System Design Strategies
> Start with Non-Functional requirements !

> Improve iteratively your system design! Simplify & Optimize ! 

## Scalability
- horizontal scaling (load balancing) needed ?
- mostly yes, when massive in data and requests 

## Latency
- Consider caching, CDN

## Availability
- in case high availability needed, then consider following:
  - redundancy
  - data center
  - figure out single point of failures

## System Design Overview
- Draw your system design !
- agree on a consistent way to draw system design i.e.
  - rectangles = service, app
  - arrows for synchronous / asynchronous communication
  - user icon
  - etc.
- Agree on a standard in your team/organisation !
