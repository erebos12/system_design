## Azure App Service

App Service enables you to build and host web apps, background jobs, mobile back-ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. It offers automatic scaling and high availability. App Service supports Windows and Linux. It enables automated deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo to support a continuous deployment model.

Azure App Service is a robust hosting option that you can use to host your apps in Azure. Azure App Service lets you focus on building and maintaining your app, and Azure focuses on keeping the environment up and running.

Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. It supports multiple languages, including .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. It also supports both Windows and Linux environments.

###  Types of app services
With App Service, you can host most common app service styles like:

- Web apps
- API apps
- WebJobs
- Mobile apps

App Service handles most of the infrastructure decisions you deal with in hosting web-accessible apps:

- Deployment and management are integrated into the platform.
- Endpoints can be secured.
- Sites can be scaled quickly to handle high traffic loads.
- The built-in load balancing and traffic manager provide high availability.

All of these app styles are hosted in the same infrastructure and share these benefits. This flexibility makes App Service the ideal choice to host web-oriented applications.
